Each number in the versions number has a meaning. The format is x.x.x.x.
From Left to Right, the first means how many people are recognizeds by
me (Z_Doctor) to be devs for this core. The second is a compatibility
number, this number gaurantees that older versions with this number 
should work as good as expected and deprecated methods are still functional;
however, deprecated methods from older versions are removed and no longer
supported. The third is for every 10th new feature added and approved
resets the counter and goes up, and every 10th one will rest this counter
and call for DCleanup. The last is for every new feature added, updates do
not count.
